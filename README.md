# OpenActive Client Library for Ruby

Dataset:

* Extract RDFa from dataset page

Feed:

* Fetch a page, parse to JSON
* Is this the last page?
* Fully process a feed, e.g. iterate from a start URL, to last page
* Process item
* Is payload standard?

Data Model:



Issues:

* Can we tell the version of the API specification that is supported?
* What if the server redirects, what do we use for paging from that point
* What should client do if there's a 404 for a page?
